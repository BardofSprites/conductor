* Conductor
A Haskell music organizer with a metadata composition language

** Syntax - IN PROGRESS
Something like this will produce a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U][m3u playlist file]] with the tracks that are obtained with the conditions provided:
#+begin_src
  songs := [filter(artist == "Artist Name") OR filter(genre == "Hip Hop")] AND (year > 1980)
#+end_src

* Planned features
1. [X] Data model for songs (with fields like artist, genre, year).
2. [-] Parser for filter language (using Megaparsec).
   + [X] Parser for Basic Syntax
     + [X] Comparison
     + [X] Operator
     + [X] Values
     + [X] Fields (Title, Artist, etc)
     + [X] FieldType
     + [X] Comparison validations
   + [ ] Parsers for commands
     + [ ] =IN PROGRESS= Filter
     + [ ] Limit
     + [ ] Sort
3. [ ] Evaluator that applies filters to song metadata.
4. [ ] Filesystem code to copy/move matched files into target directories.
5. [ ] Add playlist generation or metadata tagging features.
6. [ ] CLI interface to specify source dirs, filters, and targets.
