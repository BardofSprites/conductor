* Conductor
A Haskell music organizer with a metadata composition language

[[file:conductor.png]]

** Syntax - IN PROGRESS
Something like this will produce a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U][m3u playlist file]] with the tracks that are obtained with the conditions provided:
#+begin_src haskell
  songs <- filter(artist == "Nujabes") -- 1. adds Nujabes songs to set
        || filter(genre == "Hip Hop")  -- 2. adds Hip Hop songs to set
        && limit(year > 1990)          -- 3. limit the set to songs made after 1990

  otherSongs <- filter(artist == "Aphex Twin") -- 1. Get all songs by  aphex twin
             && limit(count == 100)            -- limit number of tracks in playlist

  result <- write $ union(songs, otherSongs) -- merges the sets together
#+end_src

* Planned features
1. [X] Data model for songs (with fields like artist, genre, year).
2. [-] Parser for filter language (using Megaparsec).
   + [X] Parser for Basic Syntax
     + [X] Comparison
     + [X] Operator
     + [X] Values
     + [X] Fields (Title, Artist, etc)
     + [X] FieldType
     + [X] Comparison validations
   + [X] Parsers for commands
     + [X] Filter
     + [X] Limit
     + [X] Sort
   + [ ] command chaining
     + with boolean operators (&& and ||)
   + [ ] Variables
     + [ ] Merge module (union/intersection/etc.. for merging two sets of songs)
     + [ ] writing to .m3u
3. [ ] Evaluator that applies filters to song metadata.
4. [ ] Add playlist generation or metadata tagging features.
5. [ ] CLI interface to specify source dirs, filters, and targets.
